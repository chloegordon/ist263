        <h2>Personal Information</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Chloe Gordon. I am a current junior majoring in <strong>Innovation, Society & Technology</strong>, with a concentration in <strong>project management</strong> and a minor in <strong>marketing</strong>.I am interested in social media marketing and how technology is changing businesses, which is what prompted me to major in this field. Moreover, I am also interested in AI and how it is evolving to impact day to day activities and jobs, so I enjoy learning about this aspect in my courses as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            One accomplishment I have is receiving an <strong>internship</strong> this summer at a PR & marketing firm. I enjoyed working here so much that I am continuing to work for the company throughout this school year as a <strong>consultant</strong> on their team. I am a strong writer and communicator, and I will always advocate for myself and others.

            I am a <strong>strong writer and communicator</strong>, and I will always advocate for myself and others. Outside of work, I enjoy playing tennis and pickleball, as well as spending time with friends and family, going for walks, and watching TV. I am currently watching a show called Scandal, and if you have not seen it, I highly recommend it. I am incredibly excited for this class and look forward to learning more!
